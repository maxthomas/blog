Welcome to my blog. I'm told that perfection is the enemy of the
good - or something like that - so I'm getting on with starting this
blog up...

... just as soon as I choose a theme...

As I see it, this blog will contain topics related to technology,
software, security and privacy, and may be a little bit of financial
and business information. That sounded super dry, but hopefully
we'll have a bit of fun along the way.

I've done a ton of work that has never seen the light of day. I hope
this blog will be a way for me to give a little something back to the
community.

Thanks for reading.
