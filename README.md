# max's blog

This repo is a copy of the raw, markdown contents of my blog.

The blog itself (aka generated `.html` files)
can be found [here][blog].

I used to use Github Pages to host the blog, so I necessarily had to
check in all the generated data. Now, I just use my own host, so I
just want to keep the content here for backup purposes, should I need
it one day.
